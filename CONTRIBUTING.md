# Contributing to mdf4-rs

Thank you for your interest in contributing to mdf4-rs! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

The maintained copy lives in the **[sigmatactical-org/mdf4-rs](https://github.com/sigmatactical-org/mdf4-rs)** repository. Open changes and issues there.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Rust and the MDF4 file format
- Latest stable release of Rust (MSRV: 1.90.0)
- Code coverage is done with `cargo-llvm-cov`

### Setting Up the Development Environment

### Code Coverage

Install `cargo-llvm-cov` using prebuilt binaries (recommended):

```bash
# Get your host target
host=$(rustc -vV | grep '^host:' | cut -d' ' -f2)

# Download and install prebuilt binary
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL \
  "https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov/releases/latest/download/cargo-llvm-cov-$host.tar.gz" \
  | tar xzf - -C "$HOME/.cargo/bin"
```

**Alternative methods:**

Using `cargo-binstall` (if installed):
```bash
cargo binstall cargo-llvm-cov
```

Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux):
```bash
brew install cargo-llvm-cov
```

### Git Pre-Commit Hook (recommended)

Install git hooks (recommended):
```bash
./setup-git-hooks.sh
```
This installs a pre-commit hook that automatically runs clippy and formatting checks before each commit.

## Development Workflow

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Build
cargo check --all-targets
cargo check --no-default-features --features alloc

# Test
cargo test --all-features

# Format
cargo fmt

# Lint
cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --no-default-features --features alloc --lib -- -D warnings
```

**Note**: The pre-commit hook automatically runs clippy and formatting checks.

### Testing and Quality Checks

**Quick reference:**
- **Tests**: Must pass with all features enabled
- **Compilation**: Must compile with `alloc` only (no_std compatible)
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80%
- **MSRV**: Must work with Rust 1.90.0

### Coding Standards

#### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use `cargo fmt` to format your code (configuration is in `rustfmt.toml`)

#### Documentation

- **All public APIs must be documented** with doc comments (`///`)
- Use code examples in documentation when helpful
- Document error conditions and return values
- Follow Rust documentation conventions

#### Error Handling

- Use `Result<T>` for fallible operations
- Use appropriate error variants (`Error::IOError`, `Error::InvalidBlock`, etc.)

#### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure tests pass with all feature combinations

#### Safety

- **No `unsafe` code** - The project uses `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#design-principles))
- Avoid `unwrap()` and `expect()` in production code (tests are fine)
- Use proper error handling with the `Result` type

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters. Explain:
- What changed and why
- Any breaking changes
- Related issues

Fixes #123
```

### Pull Requests

1. Update documentation if you're adding new features
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Reference any related issues in your PR description

#### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code follows the project's guidelines
- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test --all-features`)
- [ ] Clippy passes without warnings
- [ ] Code is formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated

### CI/CD Workflows

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Workflows automatically run on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.

- **mdf4-rs Workflow** (`.github/workflows/mdf4-rs.yml`): Tests library with `std`/`alloc`, MSRV, linting, formatting, and docs

**Best Practices:**
- Wait for CI checks to pass before merging PRs
- Fix CI failures locally before pushing
- Workflows use path-based triggers to reduce unnecessary runs
